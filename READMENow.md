# HHEAColourfulProgressView
special EAColourfulProgressView

here is the code: https://github.com/Eddpt/EAColourfulProgressView

For some reason, I delete "@IBDesignable" and "IBInspectable", it makes XIB error.
The AutoLayout is made by VFL,and if I change the progressView's width ,It will make "Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want."

thanks Eddpt
